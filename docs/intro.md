# Introduction

Welcome to **MyAccess**, a next-generation platform designed to manage digital identity, social engagement, and interactive experiences in a seamless and secure way. MyAccess is built on modern web technologies and provides a modular ecosystem for users, developers, and content providers.

---

## Overview

**MyAccess** combines account management, digital rewards, interactive modules, and personalized experiences. It aims to be a hub where users can access multiple services, connect games, manage devices, and earn digital currency in a secure and flexible environment.

Key goals of MyAccess:  
- **Unified account management:** Users have a single profile that links to multiple services and modules.  
- **Digital rewards system:** The platform uses a proprietary currency (`currency_crystal`) to reward engagement and interactions.  
- **Expandable ecosystem:** Modules like QR Login, MyID, Devices, Hub, and Games can be added or extended seamlessly.  
- **Secure sessions:** Custom session handling ensures data privacy and protects user accounts.

## Core Features

### 1. **User Profiles**
Each user has a profile that tracks activity, rewards, connected devices, and linked modules. Profiles are the backbone of MyAccess and allow users to:  
- Earn and spend `currency_crystal`.  
- Access connected services like games and apps.  
- Track their engagement and reward history.  

### 2. **MyID (Prototype)**
MyID is a digital identity prototype, currently optional and deactivated by default. Features include:  
- Activation reward: Users receive 500 `currency_crystal` upon activation.  
- Game integration: Currently, it informs users that no games are available yet. When a game is added, users will be able to connect directly through MyID.  
- Expansion-ready: Designed to integrate future digital services and interactive content.  

### 3. **Digital Currency: `currency_crystal`**
- Used to reward user engagement across the platform.  
- Earned through activating modules, connecting devices, or participating in events.  
- Can be spent on digital content, in-platform store items, or future gamified experiences.  

### 4. **Modules**
MyAccess is modular by design. Key modules include:  
- **QR Login:** Secure and convenient login using QR codes.  
- **Devices:** Manage connected devices and track activity.  
- **Hub:** Centralized dashboard for activity, notifications, and available services.  
- **Games Integration:** Future-proof design to connect and track game activity and rewards.  

### 5. **Security & Sessions**
- **Custom session management:** Ensures secure login without relying on external session frameworks.  
- **Cookie-based validation:** Protects user sessions with robust database checks.  
- **Data privacy:** User information is securely stored and handled according to modern standards.  

### 6. **Expansion & Future Vision**
MyAccess is designed to grow with user needs:  
- New modules can be integrated without disrupting the platform.  
- Game support will be added progressively.  
- Digital economy will expand with more interactive ways to earn and spend `currency_crystal`.  
- Potential for cross-platform integration with apps, websites, and external services.
